Project Overview 

The purpose of this project is to help W.Avy, the client, get adequate information to decide on whether a surf shop will be profitable to open in Oahu. In order to do this, the project entailed compiling data regarding rainfull, temperature and other parameters to see the weather conditions in Oahu and determine if the weather is conducive to surfing and therefore, will be a good location for a surf and ice cream shop. 


Results 

- June has a mean temperature of 75 degrees while december has a mean temperature of 71 degrees. These mean temperatues show that on average the weather in Oahu at different times of the year i.e. summer and winter months are still warm and will allow a surf and ice cream shop thrive. 
- The min temperature for december months is 56 degrees, which shows that although Ouha has good weather, sometimes the shop might have to close due to the weather but looking at the other data like mean, 25, 50 and 75% it can be said that this is not expected to occur often 
- In general, the min and max temperatures are as exptected and will allow for operations of a surf and ice cream shop 



Summary 


From the data provided and the queries geenrated, it can be said that Oahu will make a good location for a surf and ice cream shop. The december weather, which goes down to about 56 degrees can allow for winter surfing. The surf shop can stock winter gear to allow its customers have the option to surf all year round. 

Two additional queries that would be beneficial to gather for information for June and December will be: 
- A query looking at the rainfall for those months to make sure the surf shop will thrive. 
- A query looking at the periods will lower temperatures so that the store can plan accordingly.
